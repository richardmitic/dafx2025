| Title | Artist | Year | Time selection | Description of panning features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ’Round Midnight | Miles Davis | 1957 | 0:00–0:30 | A jazz piece recorded in mono. |
| This Is The Thing (TITT) | Fink | 2007 | 1:00–1:30 | An acoustic song with studio reverb added. The vocal switches from single-tracked to multi-tracked with moderate amplitude panning approximately halfway though the excerpt. |
| Laser Beam | Low | 2001 | 0:00–0:30 | Electric guitar, bass, and vocals with an enveloping sound created mostly by reverberation and multi-miking, but only subtle amplitude panning. |
| Manifesto | Chilly Gonzales | 2025 | 1:00–1:30 | Solo upright piano recorded live on stage with close stereo microphones. Individual notes are audibly separated in space even though no studio panning has been applied. |
| Cut And Clicks | Tetsu Inoue | 2000 | 0:00–0:30 | An electronic piece that is characterized by heavy use of extreme panning, unnatural sounds, and singular audio events with very short durations. |
| Fly Me To The Moon | Frank Sinatra | 2008 | 1:00–1:30 | A full big band recorded live. Most instruments are statically panned to a fairly strong degree. |
| I Saw Her Standing There | The Beatles | 1963 | 0:00–0:30 | A pop song with strong, rudimentary panning. Drums, bass, and lead guitar are panned hard left, while vocals and rhythm guitar are panned hard right. |
